TCP on apnet. best is 38MB/sec 

NFS on apnet with ramdisk, best is 11MB/sec

time for NFS server module to supply 32k from ramdisk: 350us

minimum latency for nfssrv call within nfssrv (from dispatch to
sendreply) is 28us

minimum read latency (for 1 8k page) is 71us

the NFS server itself is not the problem - it can deliver 90+
MB/sec. Perhaps the problem is the rpc layer?
