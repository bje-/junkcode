Trivial ramdisk for Linux 2.4

Usage:
	make
	mknod /dev/trd b 240 0
	insmod trd.o trd_size=SIZE

where SIZE is in k. You can also use any minor device numbers as
separate ram disks. eg:

	mknod /dev/trd5 b 240 5
	
then use /dev/trd* in the usual way as block devices.

Limitations:
	- memory is allocated when the device is first opened
	- there is no way to release the memory of just one minor
	device at a time
