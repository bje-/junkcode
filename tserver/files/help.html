<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

On the <a href="/">main page</a> you need to fill in the location of
the installation archive as seen from your network. You may also fill
in the location of a HTTP proxy server if you have one.<p>

Once you select "Install" your Snapserver will download the
installation archive and initialise the disk array. This will take
several minutes.
