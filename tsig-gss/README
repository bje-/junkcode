This is an implementation of a tsig-gss dynamic dns update client. It
has been tested against windows 2000 servers using MIT kerberos and
des-cbc-crc kerberos tickets.

Setup
-----

Download the Net-DNS package from http://www.net-dns.org/. Make sure
you grab at least the October 15 2002 CVS snapshot. To see if you have
the right version, it must contain a file called TKEY.pm. 

You will also need the GSSAPI-0.12 package from
http://search.cpan.org/author/PGUEN/GSSAPI-0.12/ and you will need the
MIT kerberos and MIT gssapi libraries installed.

On debian you need to install the following packages:

  libnet-dns-perl
  libgssapi-perl
  krb5-user

Kerberos setup
--------------

Here is a sample /etc/krb5.conf that works for me:

  [realms]
	VNET2.HOME.SAMBA.ORG = {
	     kdc = win2000.vnet2.home.samba.org:88
	}


Getting a ticket
----------------

You need to use kinit to get an initial ticket in the domain you wish
to update. For example:

   kinit tridge@VNET2.HOME.SAMBA.ORG

After you have a ticket use 'klist -e' to make sure you have it.

Adding an A record
------------------

The following will add an A record for myhost.vnet2.home.samba.org
with the given IP and TTL.

  nsupdate-gss myhost vnet2.home.samba.org 192.168.2.241 36000

A return value of 0 indicates success.
