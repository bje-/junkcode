This is a quick hack to allow vmware to boot ISO image files, which
means you can test an ISO without burning a cdrom.

To build just type "make" then copy fakecd.so to somewhere like /lib/
and add the path to fakecd.so into /etc/ld.so.preload

After that you just need to tell vmware to use your iso image instead
of /dev/cdrom. The ISO must have a filename ending in ".iso".
