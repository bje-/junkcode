To build a dependency list for a build do the following:

1) compile depmaker

2) put the path to depmaker.so in /etc/ld.so.preload

3) build the package like this:

   DEPMAKER=/tmp/package.dep buildcmd

where "buildcmd" is whatever command you normally use to build the
package

4) run 
   depmaker-rpm /tmp/package.dep 2> /dev/null
or
   depmaker-deb /tmp/package.dep 2> /dev/null

depending on whether you have a rpm or deb based system
