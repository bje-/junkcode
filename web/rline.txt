Run any command line driven program under readline control. 

To use it just run 'rline COMMAND' and the command will be run with
readline control.<p>

rline will try to load a completions file from one of the following locations
in this order:
<ul>
    <li> $RLINE_COMPLETIONS_FILE
    <li> $RLINE_COMPLETIONS_DIR/COMMAND
    <li> $HOME/.rline/COMMAND
    <li> /usr/share/rline/COMMAND
</ul>

A completion file consists of one completion per line, with multi-part completions
separated by spaces. You can use the special word [FILE] to mean
filename completion.<p>

Some example completion files are
