mail.runner is a script for sending and receiving email. Think of it
as a tiny replacement for fetchmail and sendmail on your client
machine.<p>

The main features of mail.runner are
<ul>
<li>good performance over very slow links
<li>secure mail transfer via rsync and ssh
<li>incremental transfer in case the link is lost
<li>no mta installation needed on the client
</ul>

To use mailrunner just download <a href="{{$JUNKCODE}}/mail.runner">mail.runner</a>
and run it with the -h option. It will display installation and usage
instructions.
