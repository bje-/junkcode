tserver is a tiny web server and templating system. It uses bash for
server side scripting, allowing you to embed arbitrary bash scripts
inside your web pages (sort of like PHP, but with bash). The web
server is small enough to be used in embedded systems (which is why I
wrote it - I needed a flashable web server with scripting).<p>

These web pages are generated using the templating system.

{{! echo "$DIR_SOURCE" }}
